# Utopian-Tree
This C# program calculates the height of a “Utopian Tree” after `n` growth cycles. The `utopianTree` function starts with height 1 and, for each cycle, doubles the height in spring (odd cycles) and adds 1 in summer (even cycles). The `Main` method reads the number of test cases and cycles, calls the function for each case, and outputs the resulting tree heights.
